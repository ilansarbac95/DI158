suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments before each query to explain the expected output based on the puzzle's instructions. This would demonstrate the thought process before execution.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately creates the tables, inserts the data, and executes the provided SQL queries. The output matches the expected results based on the provided table data and SQL logic, directly addressing the challenge's requirement to determine the output of each query.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of comments to delineate sections (creation, insertion, queries) improves readability. Consistent formatting and meaningful variable names also contribute positively.
- performance: The code uses in-memory SQLite, which is efficient for this small dataset. The queries themselves are straightforward and do not introduce any performance bottlenecks.
- security: Since the code operates on an in-memory database and doesn't involve external data sources or user input, security risks are minimal. The use of parameterized queries would further enhance security if the code were to interact with user-supplied data, but it's not necessary in this specific case.
