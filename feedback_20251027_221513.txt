suggestions for improvement:
- The code addresses the first part of the instructions by counting the actors in the table. However, it doesn't attempt to add a new actor with blank fields to observe the outcome, as specified in the instructions.
- The use of an in-memory database (`:memory:`) is suitable for testing and doesn't write to disk, which is fine for this exercise.
- Consider adding code that attempts to insert an actor with missing fields to fully address the problem statement.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code only partially addresses the prompt. It counts the actors, which satisfies the first instruction. However, it fails to attempt inserting an actor with blank fields as specified in the second instruction. Therefore, the correctness is 50%.
- readability: The code is well-structured and includes comments explaining each step, enhancing readability. The use of descriptive variable names also contributes to its readability.
- performance: The performance is good, especially given the use of an in-memory database. The queries are simple and efficient.
- security: The code doesn't involve user inputs or external data, so it's relatively secure. Parameterized queries are used for insertion, preventing SQL injection.
