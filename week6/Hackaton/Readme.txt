📚 README - Hackathon Project: Buried - A Survival Visual Novel

Project Title
--------------
Buried Alive
A text-based survival visual novel game created in Python.

Description
--------------
In this game, the player wakes up trapped inside a coffin, buried underground with only an old flip phone and a weak signal.
With only 12% battery life and bad network reception, they must make choices that will determine if they survive — or die.

This project was created as part of the Python Hackathon challenge to practice:
- Python programming
- JSON data handling
- SQLite database basics (optional extension)
- Faker library for random data
- Basic file management
- Game logic and event handling

Files
--------------
- main.py : Main Python script that runs the game logic
- scenes_buried.json : JSON file containing all the game scenes, texts, choices, and events
- README.txt : This explanation file

How to Run
--------------
1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a new terminal in VSCode (Terminal > New Terminal).
3. Make sure you are inside the project folder.
4. Run the following command:

    python main.py

✅ Your Visual Novel will start directly in the terminal.

Technologies Used
--------------
- Python (main code logic)
- JSON (game content structure)
- Faker (random name generation for characters)
- Random (randomized events like network loss, insect attacks)
- (Optionally) SQLite (to implement save/load system)

Game Highlights
--------------
- Stressful atmosphere (low battery, weak signal, lack of oxygen)
- Random events (network loss, insect attacks)
- Choices matter: different paths can lead to life or death
- Breath, battery, and network management
