        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",

        "**2. What is an instance?**  \n",
        "An instance is an individual object created from a class. It holds actual data and can use the methods defined in its class.\n",

        "**3. What is encapsulation?**  \n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain details of an object and only exposing whatâ€™s necessary through methods (getters/setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is abstraction?**  \n",
        "Abstraction means hiding the complexity of the system and showing only essential features. It helps in reducing programming complexity.\n",

        "**5. What is inheritance?**  \n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting reusability.\n",

        "**8. What is method resolution order (MRO)?**  \n",
        "MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It determines which method gets called in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n"
